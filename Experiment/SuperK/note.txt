Since SK has very poor sensitivity to hep flux, I simply fix it to best fit of combined SK, i.e. 12.3e3 cm^2 sec.

I have tested shape distortion resulted from hep flux, and I found that when hep flux varies between 8e3 and 50e3 cm^2 sec, the total distortion is almost in range [14,20]MeV. Variation in hep flux results in about 0.5% error on Detectable Ratio, while it is too small compared to statistical errors in the corresponding range.

Also, fix hep flux will fix theoretical shape at the same time, making minimization faster.

i.e.

The predicted detectable ratio does not depend on flux. This is very important.
While again I should emphasize that predicted ratio does depend on phase, since they have different detector response functions.


I decide to regard (SK's systematic uncertainty from spectrum) uncorrelated
with JP. This is incorrect, but now JP's systematic uncertainty has not been
studied. Since uncertainty from spectrum is not a leading term, this should
not affect too much.
