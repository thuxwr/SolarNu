This file records all the references for the Solar neutrino data.

** Spectrum

* Be7
  
  http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/7belineshape.html
  
  The file contains the data used to plot Figure 2 and Figure 3 of 
  ¡°The 7Be Neutrino Line: A reflection of the central temperature 
  of the Sun,¡± Phys. Rev. D 49 (1994) 3923.
  
  The file contains, first, the probability distribution for the 
  emitted neutrinos as a function of observed neutrino 
  (energy - 861.8 keV) for the ground state transition and, then, the 
  probability distribution as a function of observed neutrino 
  (energy - 384.3 keV) for the excited state transition. 

  The original file is split into two files for TTree.

  (The header of the file is wrong, and it says 861.3, should be 861.8 keV.)

* B8

  http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/b8spectrum.html

  This table contains the best-estimated standard solar neutrino 
  energy spectrum from ^8B decay, along with two spectra that are 
  +/- 3 effective standard deviations away from the best-estimated 
  spectrum. The construction of the spectrum using laboratory data 
  is described in the paper published in Phys. Rev. C, 54, 411 
  (1996). This paper also contains a detailed discussion of the 
  principal uncertainties that affect the determination of the 
  neutrino energy spectrum.

* CNO
  
  http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/cnospectra.html

  The files made available here are the energy spectra for the 13N, 
  15O, and 17F solar neutrino sources. These are the undistorted 
  energy spectra, as they are created in the sun. If you want to 
  refer to the source of these files, you can cite either J. N. 
  Bahcall and R. K. Ulrich, Rev. Mod. Phys. 60, 297 (1988) or 
  J. N. Bahcall, Neutrino Astrophysics (Cambridge Univ. Press). 
  The spectra are produced as described in those sources.

* pp
  
  http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/ppspectrum.html

  The normalized pp energy spectrum for solar neutrinos is given 
  in steps of 5.0406 keV. The spectrum is taken from Table IV of 
  the paper "Gallium Solar Neutrino Experiments: Absorption Cross 
  Sections, Neutrino Spectra, and Predicted Event Rates", Phys. 
  Rev. C.  56 3391(1997). 

* hep

  http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/sndata.html#hepspec
  
  The hep energy spectrum extends to 18.8 MeV, well beyond the 
  endpoint of the 8B neutrino energy spectrum. In principle, hep 
  neutrinos may be detectable in the SuperKamiokande and SNO solar 
  neutrino experiments (see discussion in Bahcall-Ulrich, RMP, 60, 
  297, 1988). The predicted flux of the rare hep neutrinos is 
  proportional to the low-energy cross section for 
  3He + p  4He + e+ + e. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find 
  a reliable way of estimating an uncertainty in this production 
  cross section, since the reaction is forbidden and the calculated 
  value involves strong cancellation between terms from different 
  sources.

  The spectrum given here includes the thermal fusion energy 
  calculated in Phys. Rev. C, 56, 3391 (1997). The uncertainty in 
  the shape of the hep energy spectrum is negligible in the context 
  of solar neutrino research.

* pep

  Only one bin at 1.442 MeV

* Two Be7 and pep lines are put into a shape of a single bin of 0.0001 MeV wide.
  They should not be delta functions. So a single narrow bin makes sense.
