All data in 2nu, 3nu and 4nu are drawn by calling DrawProb.C.
Then one can use graphs from class SurvProb.


One should first verify how many flavors and what parameters to calculate in DrawProb.C, then run compile.csh to generate DrawProb (executive), finally use run.py to submit jobs to server.

Warning: Do not compile it when jobs are running on server!
